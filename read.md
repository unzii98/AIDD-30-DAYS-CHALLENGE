What software development means to me:
For me, building software is about having support that helps at every step. It’s like having a mentor around all the time — someone who helps me think through problems, suggests better ways to do things, and prevents me from getting stuck for hours. With this kind of support, I can focus more on being creative and solving real problems. It makes coding faster, smoother, and more enjoyable, giving me confidence as I learn and create.

How I see the future of software development:
I think the future will be about working with tools that feel like a real teammate. Routine tasks will get handled automatically, ideas will come faster, and potential issues will be easier to spot. This will let developers focus on creativity, decision-making, and building things that truly matter. Development will feel less like struggling alone and more like collaborating with a partner who’s always ready to help.

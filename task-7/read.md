# 📘 SpecKit Plus – Overview

## 🚀 What is SpecKit Plus?

**SpecKit Plus** is an advanced implementation of the **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology.  
Instead of writing code first and thinking about specifications later, SpecKit Plus forces you to start with **clear, detailed specifications** and then lets AI-powered agents generate code based on them.

It provides a clean, structured, and organized workflow so you never get lost during development.  
Your idea grows through **five clear stages**, each improving understanding and reducing confusion.

## 🔹 The Five Stages of SpecKit Plus

### 1️⃣ `/constitution` – Project Rulebook  
This is the foundation of your project.  
You define the **rules, goals, limitations, ethics, standards**, and the overall direction.

The constitution tells the AI:

- What the project is about  
- What it should and should not do  
- The expected behavior and standards  

It sets the project’s "mindset."

---

### 2️⃣ `/specify` – Clear Specification  
Here you describe **exactly what you want to build**.

The AI generates a complete specification including:

- Features  
- Purpose  
- Inputs and outputs  
- Functionality  
- Success criteria  

This step turns your idea into something concrete and well-defined.

---

### 3️⃣ `/plan` – Development Roadmap  
Once the specification is set, the `/plan` command creates a detailed roadmap for development.

It includes:

- Architecture  
- Workflow  
- Tools and technologies  
- System structure  
- Implementation strategy  

This stage answers: **How will we build it?**

---

### 4️⃣ `/tasks` – Break Into Small Steps  
The `/tasks` command breaks the large plan into **small, manageable tasks**.

Each task contains:

- A clear objective  
- Requirements  
- Expected output  

Examples:

- Build homepage  
- Create login form  
- Connect database  
- Add search function  

This step removes confusion and keeps development organized.

---

### 5️⃣ `/implement` – Coding Phase  
This is where development actually begins.

Using `/implement`, AI:

- Writes real code  
- Follows tasks step-by-step  
- Builds working features  

Because the earlier stages were clear, implementation becomes smooth and error-free.

## ✨ Summary

**SpecKit Plus** helps you:

- Think clearly  
- Organize your project  
- Reduce mistakes  
- Work step-by-step  
- Use AI effectively  
- Build clean, structured software  

It turns your idea → into a specification → into a plan → into tasks → into a working project.

TASK 2

🧠 Nine Pillars – Understanding
Why AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) help system architects:

⚙️ Automates repetitive setup tasks

🧩 Focus on system-level thinking

🧠 Reduces cognitive load

🚀 Helps learn faster

📈 Improves productivity


TASK 2

How Nine Pillars help become an M-Shaped Developer:

🤖 AI-assisted coding improves depth

⚡ Automated environments increase speed & reliability

🪲 Intelligent debugging improves problem-solving

📄 Documentation improves communication & code quality

🏗 Architecture guidance builds strong system-design skills

🔍 Testing automation builds reliability

🔧 DevOps improves cross-domain awareness

📚 Continuous learning unlocks multi-specialization

🌟 All combined → creates an M-shaped developer


TASK 2

🏛 Architecture Thinking
Impact on developer role:

Developer becomes a system designer, not just coder

Thinks in terms of flows, interactions, components

Designs scalable and maintainable systems


TASK 2

Why think in layers & systems:

🧹 Avoids spaghetti code

🧱 Clear separation of responsibilities

🔧 Easier debugging & testing

📦 Modular & future-proof software

👥 Better team collaboration


TASK 2

🔄 Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development (SDD)
❌ Problems with Vibe Coding:

No clear plan → messy code

Hard to maintain

Requirements shift

Debugging becomes slow

Collaboration suffers


TASK 2

✅ How SDD fixes these issues:

Clear written specs before coding

Predictable & structured workflow

Easier debugging & scaling

Team follows same roadmap

Cleaner, more reliable systems


TASK 2

📝 MCQs with Correct Answers

Purpose of SDD:
✅ B. Clear requirements before coding begins

Mindset shift in AIDD:
✅ B. Thinking in systems and clear instructions

Biggest failure of Vibe Coding:
✅ B. Architecture becomes hard to extend

Main advantage of AI CLI agents:
✅ B. Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving

Definition of M-Shaped Developer:
✅ C. Deep skills in multiple related domains
